{"title":"Does the Lucinda Bassett program work?","thread":[{"content":"I stumbled across a few posts referencing the Lucinda Bassett program (Midwest Center for Stress and Anxiety).  Browsing the net, I was skeptical as to the validity of the reviews for the program.  I was wondering if any of you have tried the program.  For those of you who have, how would you rate the program and were the results significant and sustained?","author":"ryn21","postID":"post_2837941","date":"20080428-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"/personal_pages/user/97676"},{"content":"Does it \"work.\" Yeah, it works really well for her -she's making money on that stuff. Does it work for others? The answers range from \"never\" to \"sometimes\" to \"always.\" Just for fun, let me do a search on Ebay and see what we come up with (goes to Ebay). I see that the price on her web site is 8 easy payments of about $60 each -that's $480 buckos. And I see that Ebay has it for about half that or less. So that gives you of an idea of how the market values it when a \"free economy\" is involved. And I also see that to even FIND the price on her web site involves some digging -so it appears to me she's a bit nervous about presenting her price right up front (and she's all about NOT being nervous -go figure). But lets get down to cases here: meds don't \"work,\" therapy doesn't \"work,\" books and CD's don't \"work,\" and nothing at all just \"works\" all by itself. It's not like a solar powered outdoor light that you stick in the ground and it just sort of lights up by itself at night. The WORK is done by YOU; your brain changes and heals just like a broken leg or blister -the solution is all inside of YOU. The meds, the CD's, the books and baying at the moon while throwing chicken bones on the ground are ALL TOOLS. I'm not just trying to make fun of this stuff -really I'm not. I'm trying to get across the point of view that puts you -puts anybody- in the best position to understand the entire approach to recovery. And so, back to our friend Lucinda: if her approach -the workbooks, the carry cards, the CD's and all the rest of it \"connect\" with you in terms of how you would feel best about handling your recovery, then give it a shot (but do it at Ebay). But bear in mind that there are no medicinal or magical properties to the 75 cents worth of plastic and paper you'll get. If it \"works\" at all, it will do so because YOU did the work. My own approach was to use a psychiatrist - a living, breathing human who could respond to me in real time. I would have gone nutz digging out a wallet card of things to say to myself, or dashing home or to my car to listen to a CD. But THAT may be your cup of tea! If it is, pour it on. Just understand that YOU do the \"work.\" OK? OK!","author":"JSGeare","replyTo":"ryn","postID":"post_2842396","date":"20080429-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"/personal_pages/user/366811"},{"content":"Amen!!!

I once thought about trying the Lucinda Bassett program, but something told me there was something a little off with it. I mean, why is this lady on TV so much and have so many ads, etc? That shows me that it is a money thing, not a helping thing. The best things in life really are free (or at least low cost). This may not surprise anyone who knows me on here, but I would recommend you go to the library or bookstore and get a copy of \"Hope and Help for your Nerves\" by Dr. Claire Weekes. To emphasize JS's message, this is not a cure all (nothing is), but it helps get you in the frame of mind that you need to be in - this is an illness and can be cured (or at least coped with easily). I have had GAD for more than 7 years now and have tried so many things, so I think by the time I read this book I was READY to be done with it. This book has seriously changed my life. I am nearly 100% anxiety free (on most days) and really have my life back. Again, I am not preaching Gospel here or anything nor am I the man with the magic elixir, but hey - reading this can ONLY help and will not hurt at all. Good Luck and remeber, until you realize that it is inside of you to heal this thing and it is a state of mind (and that state of mind is that you WANT to get better) anxiety will win every time. So don't let it.

This is a fifteen week program that helps you attain skills to stop your panic attacks or other symptoms you may have. My fiancé actually ordered the program after having an panic attack and I am going through the program as well so that I may better understand the condition. I am finding that I too have the condition in certain aspects and have benefited from just the first three weeks. To the persons who note Ebay and the selling of the product I would point out that the program is updated so you may be getting an older version of the program (thus the price cut). The workbooks that come with the program are key to success as started several times in the audio and video program so be sure to get and use them! For the person who argues the infomercial and advertisement programs... well we can all look at the Bowflex and how long they have been advertising, its because the product works. I too was skeptical for a long time due to the price and the exaggerated promises, however just like this program if you stick to the guidelines it will work. Diet and exercise and cutting off the caffeine and sugars will help reduce and or eliminate some of the anxious feelings you may have (as stated in the program) but the program will certainly help you attain those skills needed to understand why you are feeling the way you are and to change them, for this the program is priceless.","author":"dean85","postID":"post_3804253","date":"20081224-00:00:00 -0500","authorID":"/personal_pages/user/718027"},{"content":"I am Roger in Texas and have tried many different things.

I followed the instructions precisely and used the tapes and workbook religiously. I saw rapid improvement and drastic changes after the first six weeks, which continued until I finished the program. That was in June 2008 and though I still might have occasional feelings of anxiety, I feel I can handle it without fear. One thing I think every person should consider is how much they desire to get over their anxiety and depression. I had hit rock-bottom and worried about whether or not I was making real progress with my therapist when I started it. I've tried passing this program on to a couple of other people and they all thought it was corny or stupid and quit. Being a skeptic myself, I realize I would have quit this program as well if I had not reached dire levels of depression and agoraphobia. Seeing how much I had sunk made me commit to the program no matter how silly I might have thought certain parts of it were. For this program to give you any benefit, you are required to have an open mind about what it tries to teach you. I believe that a committed person will get a lot from the program alone, but seeing a therapist in addition to the program will be more beneficial. My therapist had me learning some CBT techniques, but they were disjointed and unstructured. It was the structure of Lucinda's program that made a difference for me. However, an important part of my recovery was having a therapist. Certain questions came up for me in the program that my therapist was able to help me with even though she was unfamiliar with the program I was using. The program is great, but having a professional to help guide you is necessary as well. Considering how beneficial the program was to my overall success over the most debilitating aspects of my panic and anxiety, it would have been worth spending the money to the buy the program instead of downloading it. I'm even considering buying the program anyways so that the makers will get some compensation for the help they've given me.","author":"drdoombot","replyTo":"Those Wondering About Lucinda's Program","postID":"post_3819365","date":"20081230-00:00:00 -0500","authorID":"/personal_pages/user/722118"},{"content":"Yes!

First, I will sum it up and give you my honest feedback to get to the chase. Then I will go into more detail and share my experience. Here goes : I dont believe Lucinda Bassetts program/ tapes are the most effective. I am sure everyone has different experiences and / or progress. But, I honestly think it is a waste of money and definitely not worth the investment. Why ? 1. There are numerous tapes included. Most people do not have the time to watch all of those tapes and just give up without trying it ! Thats probably why some ppl never had any positive results. Plus, it just added more anxiety and made my condition worse at the time. (which is normal as Lucinda states in the program) As most ppl suffering anxiety, the typical reaction would be :: The thought of not doing it perfectly, re watching the same CD over and over uptil it is fully absorbed , and of course dreading going through the whole process of watching NUMEROUS tapes about ANXIETY, a topic we refuse to ACCEPT or procrastinate about doing ! We have anxiety. At first, it is common to have a negative reaction or it can actually INCREASE your anxiety ! But, when do you see results or have the patience to go STEP by STEP and watch every single tape ? We are expecting instant results 1-2-3 ! Do most of us have the perserverance or positive attitude to go through the whole program simply BELIEVING it will work ? Probably NO, that is why I believe it doesnt work for everyone. 2. I definitely did not watch her whole CDS, and every single tape. Why ? Well, definitely because I couldnt go through another second of her \"physcho babble talk\". I find most of it to be not very helpful or too much filter and very TIME CONSUMING. I think she speaks to you like a \"patient\", that is in a hospital and in the recovery zone. Who wants to feel like they are in a recovery zone and making BABY STEPS to get better each day ? I think she could have summed up her tapes, and made a realistic 1-3 CD program and charged a decent price so more ppl can benefit. I am sure she is aware that most ppl suffering from anxiety will not benefit if they purchase this expensive program. WHY ? Simply, because they probably will NOT go through the whole program STEP by STEP and will give up. Does her nonsense phsycho babble talk in numerous CDS add up ? I definitely dont think so. What do I believe is GREAT about her program ? ( Of course, I dont believe you have to BUY her program to adapt these principles, and can achieve these results on your own of course elsewhere) 1. Accepted that you have anxiety, etc. Accepting it, and loving yourself and understanding you are creative, etc. 2. Understanding the root, cause, and understanding your anxiety, (or whatever) diagnosing the common symptoms, and simply are more aware of anxiety and all of the effects and causes. 3. Googling positive influences that have anxiety, or even bipolar. ( ex. Einstein, Mozart, ) etc. 4. Finding ways to improve your lifestyle to decrease anxiety : dont drink coffee, eat junk food, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. 5. Write a journal everyday and notice progress. She mentions its not great to bottle your emotions inside, or over analzye any situation, etc. 6. You can chat with others who are suffering anxiety. This makes you feel like you are not alone, and understand we have similiar experiences. 7. Meditation. She mentions meditation is very important. I would recommend various meditation links on youtube. (cheaper) Meditation was very helpful. I simply believe that you dont have to purchase her whole CDS, system to recover from anxiety. I believe that if you simply become more aware of your condition, understand it, accept, change your lifestyle a bit, and apply some principles, you can see results. I believe it can be helpful, but I know there are cheaper ways to get results ! Running definitely helped me. Her tapes did help me in many ways. Unfortunately, I didnt go through the whole CDS, but I found help other ways, by googling more about anxiety, changing my diet, became more positive, confident, accepting it, and stop overanalzying things and live for the moment.","author":"kandle37","replyTo":"Ryn and everyone","postID":"post_4941937","date":"20091004-00:00:00 -0400","authorID":"/personal_pages/user/1062949"},{"content":"Be carefull and alert.

Honestly, I like it alot and have learned alot from it. It did alot to help me understand my anxiety and decreased my panic attacks ten fold. I do have a few \"buts\". Would I recommend it to someone with GAD? Maybe. Would I to someone with ocd or adhd? Not a chance. With all the materials it comes with I don't think it's that great for those of us that have problems paying attention, like me. I've never been able to work it \"completely\" because I can't stay focused for 4 months. I must caution not to try to do it all at once or skip around cuz it freaked me out real bad (they tell you not too, but I got over excited when I got it). I would also suggest a really cheap way to try it. Get her book \"From Panic To Power\". It has ALOT of the information from the program in it, plus a few other tips. My library carries it, so you could check there or get it cheap off amazon. If that helps you then you could try the program. It's kinda like she's trying to give you do it yourself therapy in a box. I think it's great if you can't see a therapist and/or a psychiatrist, but I think your best bet would be the book, therapy, and medication if neccessary, meds aren't for everyone and I think some dr's are quick to put everyone on a pill and not everyone needs them.

I have suffered from anxiety and panic disorder on and off my whole life. When I purchased the program I was at my lowest point and that is what Lusinda takes advantage of to get your money. Here is what I have learned. Anxiety and Panic Disorders are not just in your head. These problems we suffer from are very unfortunate and the worst part is the medical profession really does not seem to know much about them. It saddens me to see frauds like Lusinda pray on good people that are at the end of their rope with an illness they don't seem to be able to control. I finally saught help with a phyciatrist and when I went the Dr. was an Indian guy that could hardly speak english, I said to my self oh great...... This Dr. actually saved my life, He was younger and did a lot of extra research into panic and anxiety. Here is what he explained to me: He said many people who suffer from these illnesses actually have chemical imbalances. He went to explain to me that the brain has a pump that pumps saratonin from one side of the brain to the other. People with anxiety are over stimulated and therefore the pump sends too much saratonin to the other side too fast. At the time I was on xanex from my regular doctor and he demanded I go off of them. I wanted to hit him because they did provide me with some sort of relief. Now keep in mind at this point in time I was close to house ridden having in excess of 10 panic attacks a day and not being able to drive. He suggested I go on Lexapro which is an anti-depresent. Again I was skeptical and agreed. He started me on a low dose which 5mg and then took me up to 10mg. He told me this medicine would take a few months before I started noticing a difference because it would retrain the pump in your brain to pump less amounts of saratonin. He was absolutely right!!! after about 6 months the panic attacks stoped and I was on my way. Lusinda is a crook, if she is so concerned about your illness like she acts on commercials then why does her program cost so much money for some stupid cd's telling you to cope with symptoms to anxiety... I remember in one cd she said there is no lion ready to attack you. Lusinda is the lion ready to attack your wallet!!! I know first hand how bad this can be and I hope this will help someone and if anyone would like more help with this please don't hesitate to email me at ***@**** I would be more than happy to help you with any information that I have had to learn the hard way through many years of misinformation and scam artists like Lusinda.

Yes, I purchased the Bassett program many years ago, and I don't have anything bad to say about it. But, sometimes, it's not all in your attitude and how you think about things. Sometimes, there is a physical, chemical component to it as well. With this understanding, I began BHRT (bio-identical hormone replacement therapy) a couple years back, at the age of 52. There are some things that you might discover in the initial evaluation that might blow your mind. For one, they check pretty much everything in the initial blood/saliva analysis. My doctor told me that I had one of the lowest vitamin D3 counts he had ever seen. So, he put me on that supplement. Read up on it, and you'll see  how it can relate to depression and anxiety. My testosterone levels were \"normal\", as my family physician always told me, but what he didn't tell me is that \"normal\" covers such a large range, that telling me it's \"normal\" meant nothing. So, my BHRT doctor boosted my levels up substantially. Just those two things alone helped incredibly. The thing I liked about doing this is that now I know EXACTLY which vitamins and minerals I need, rather than buying and taking a load of supplements, hoping I get what I need. Yes, this costs a bit, but it's worth it. Check it out, and, if nothing has worked for you so far, this might be the ticket.

Unfortunately, it is not an exact science, no matter the approach. One really does have to find out what works for that person, and keep on trying. I think that this program is helpful for me, but it does not necessarily replace other therapy, it depends what one needs. For the cost, it is less than what I was paying for 10 therapy sessions, and I was getting a reasonably low price. I am completing a Master's degree in counseling psychology, so I am not by any means against one on one therapy. There is much value in talking to someone regularly who can personalize counseling to one's individual needs and preferences. Programs such as this one can help also. It's another tool to use. What \"works\" is not the same for everyone. That's why there so many approaches to therapy out there.

My belief is that a combination of cognitive therapy, support group, meditation and yoga were all a part of the process of regaining myself. With that said, meditation and visualization are like any other physical exercise. To reap benefits, you must practice the \"exercises\" regularly. It takes a bit of time for most people to be able to do this. It is not a magic bullet or cure all but really teaches you the coping skills to manage anxiety and panic attacks. It's been 14 years since my last full blown panic attack. Not to say I don't have moments of anxiety but I know now how to effectively deal with it and cut it off before it gets out of control. Most importantly, everyone should be checked out medically to be sure there isn't a physical cause of the symptoms such as thyroid imbalance and other things before assuming it's just nerves.

Best way to deal is one day at a time. I  added the lucinda bassett program into my routine about 2 yrs ago and i think its worth it. I have been trying to couple it with with a healthier lifestyle thru excercise to burn the stress and anxiety, eating healthier, Self improvement through meditation and yoga are all vital in healing process. Some days easier then others, its debilitating especially when u constantly feel u are being tried by people, life, regrets, demons...etc etc.! For me its a genetic condition, mom and sis struggle. my anxiety extended from growing up in a negative environment. No one has a perfect life, it isnt usually everything we hoped it would bee! nevertheless, we can change it, doesnt matter who u are. The lucinda bassett program teaches you how to reform your thought process but not by way of hypnosis, through discussions and excercises it helps you rebuild a positive outlook and thought process so that you no longer  beat  yourself down everyday. It gives you the tools to overcome certain fears related to anxiety. Basically the Power of positive thinking, there is a little more to it But you have to be committed to the journey and making the improvement like it was mentioned above it needs to be done by you. U need to decide that you are done with the turmoil,  this condition will not continue to controll your life. Decide that you want to be happy, know that you can change simply because you want to and Commit yourself to nothing but dreaming up the life you want, who and what you want to be and reinvent yourself. Because thats what all about, no one said it would be easy, the steuggle is meant to make us stronger. Sounds cliche but the mind is a powerful thing!.

I was slowly fading away and was forced to move back in with my mother who thought i was crazy along with everyone else. I was laying in the bed pne night with my mom because uh yea i could no longer sleep alone either. An infomercial came on and in my sleep i kept hearing these symptoms that i had..so i opened my eyes and woke up my mother. I said, mom this is it! This is what i am goubg through! At this point she was so worried that she was willing to do anything. My bday was a few days away and she offered to get this as my gift. I checked the mail everyday anticipating its arrival. I got it..opened it..it was so easy to follow. Videos to looj at..cassettes to listen to..literature to read was all i had to do. It was so easy. Literally, in a week, i was drivibg again..hanging with my friends..going to stores ALONE! I was so grateful and felt so blessed that God woke me up that night.

I think the things which helped me were first the medication and then time. Time will heal it. The psychiatrist and psychologist were not helpful in my opinion. They were just good because they could provide medical certificates which I could get off from my work for a couple of months. Being away from work and spending my time with my loved ones was very helpful. I think for a person with anxiety, it will be difficult to change his/her mind. Because, the brain is stopped from working. The only thing that can help is just to provide a place in which he/she feels safe and calm.

I arrived to find a smallish room crammed with people, all eyeing the door. It turns out that it was one of Lucinda Bassett's first forays to expand beyond her home state of Ohio (this was in Louisville). I went through the group meetings and came to know Lucinda, but more so her sister, Donna. They invited me to co-facillitate the upcoming six-week program, which I did, under the guidance of a licensed psychologist. It's important to remember that in those days, folks with all types of anxiety disorders were rather novel in that psychology had not dealt with this issue very frequently. I had personally been to any number of doctors, looking for either a physiological or psychological cure - to no avail. At one point I was put on Prozac and on the fifth day was eyeing a butcher knife, wondering how it would feel to run it down my arm (I was NOT suicidal up to this point.) A call to my psychiatrist returned, \"Oh, you're just having another panic attack. Double the dose.\"  I would never have survived had my husband not thrown the bottle into the garbage. A year later, a patient of the same doctor who was on Prozac for depression took an automatic rifle to his workplace and killed or injured a dozen people. A second physican prescribed the beginning of what turned out to be a 17-year nightmare of addiction to Ativan. (The manufacturer withheld notation of its addictive quality and thus became the focus of the largest class action lawsuit in Britain's history when it surfaced.) It is harder to kick than heroin and the only help doctors could give was to substitute it with another drug, equally addictive. Thus, I had to wean myself in micro-levels or risk possible deadly consequences. I am now completely drug free. Many people do not realize that once you begin benzodiazepines or some of the other class drugs, no private insurance company will cover you. They believe the cost of attempted suicides to be prohibitive, even if you are not suicidal.  It is a very misunderstood condition. Sadly, Donna was diagnosed with lukemia shortly thereafter and passed away, leaving her daughter, whom, Lucinda told me in a phone conversation, she was helping to raise. There were many in the groups who were vastly helped by the program. I had been suffering from panic attacks already for 20 years at that point. While the program definitely helped, it actually was being undermined by an abusive marriage I could not leave at that time - thus the program's efficacy was not fairly tested.  Lucinda developed her program based on her own formula for recovery - and I don't believe she ever represents anything to the contrary. There have been thousands of people helped by the program, but it takes dedication and a desire to get better. Many of the comments I'm reading here indicate that these folks have a negative attitude and therefore likely could not benefit from its concepts. I do chide them by saying that it isn't fair to condemn something that works for so many, simply because it does not work for you. The expense of Lucinda's program I believe is in part due to two things:  1) the original program was on cassette tape - about 20 cassettes - and the mere packaging was expensive. 2) As the program grew beyond what she could produce privately, she put fulfillment into the hands of a professional company and they likely added a healthy commission for themselves. They are professional marketers and their technique is hard sell and reluctance to take returns. This is typical - I just went through the same arrangement with the folks at Keronique. Naturally many of the people who suffer from severe anxiety are unable to work and this cost is considerable for them. About four years ago I ordered the program again on DVD and have converted them to my iTunes so they can travel with me. I'm revisiting them now and find them exceedingly informative - her techniques having been refined by decades of successful clients. I can only underscore \"decades\" - and point out that obviously she is helping people or she would not have survived this long. If you are sincere about introspection and the desire to change your attitude so that anxiety does not underscore your every thought - then this program will work for you.  If it works, then it is well, well worth the cost.

I tried many things. I want to get to the point quickly. Try these steps. These were the most helpful behavioral changes I made and they have helped me enormously. (And yes, my situation was very serious) #1  Breath. Whenever you feel that \"wave\" starting to build and come at you: Breath slow and deep for a count of 4 (or whatever count works with your breathing) on an in breath, then breath out for a count of 8. Do this for at least a minute or more. Then #2 speak kindly to yourself. Say things like. \" It is OK. You know what this is. You will get through it. You always have. You are not having a heart attack, or going crazy.\"  Also, I created my own little mantra you are welcome to use....I am happy and healthy and whole and well. Repeat over and over when you feel on edge. #3 Tell everyone that matters that you may at times (not always convenient times) experience panic attacks or anxiety to the point where you may need to leave, or change what you are doing, or just seem a bit out of it. In my life, most everyone was awesome, and it opened doors for me to help others who often said \" Oh my god, you do? I do too.\". I found out a huge number of the people I know have experienced this at some point. #4 You are you not the \"issue\". Try not to own it. You do not \"have\" anxiety. You only experience it. Don't let it control you by making it a part of yourself. #5 Relaxation recordings really can help. I used to have a CD next to my bed for helping me go to sleep at night ( a time when stressful thoughts can take hold). There are now a lot of relaxation recordings on the internet for free. Try a few, see what works for you. #6 Let a panic attack wash over you at least once without fighting it. Just give in to it. Find out that it will not kill you or make you lose your mind. It can be scary and tiring, but the fear of it is where it's greatest power lies. Let the fear out of it like air out of a balloon.                                                                                                           I hope this helps. I have not had more than reasonable anxiety for the past 10 years, even though I have been through untold amounts of challenges. Even when my mother died, my dad had a stroke, my daughter became my son and my physical health suffered some huge setbacks, I still did not go back to that place of overwhelming anxiety.                                                   And, yes, after doctors and some meds (that only made things more complicated), I did use Lucinda's book and tapes, and visited a good therapist, and changed a lot of behaviors (like more care for and time for myself), and upped my walks, and changed my one cup of coffee to one cup of decaf. Try many things, and don't lose hope. Find a friend to talk to. Cry it out ( I had 44 years of held in tears to purge).
